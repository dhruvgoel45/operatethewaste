    <h2 style="color:black"><b>Introduction</b></h2>
    <p style="color:black">
        The popularity of plastic, which began rising in the 1950s, is growing out of control, 8.2 trillion pounds of plastic have been produced around the world, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Science Advances. And there’s no sign of slowing down, considering scientists say that another 26.5 trillion pounds will be produced worldwide by 2050.
    </p>
    <p style="color:black">
If you take a look around your kitchen or office right now, chances are you’ll notice you’re surrounded by plastic. There are water bottles, to-go coffee cups, straws, plastic grocery bags, food wrappers, take-out containers, single-serve coffee pods, disposable utensils, and produce bags. These are all examples of single-use plastic products, and they’re responsible for much of the pollution in our world and especially the ocean.

    <h1><b>Real life example</b>

    </h1>
    <p>
        •	The ever-increasing sizes of the garbage mountains in the National Capital is becoming a grave concern and posing health hazards to people living around them with the solid waste management becoming an acute problem, especially with the tackling of plastic waste </p>
        <p>
•	The landfills at Bhalswa, Ghazipur and Okhla are already overloaded, but in absence of an alternative more waste is being dumped on these sites only. The Bhalswa dairy in north-west Delhi also lies in the backdrop of a garbage mound </p>
<p>
•	According to the locals, at least five people from the Bhalaswa dairy lost their lives in last five months. They died of blood cancer and tuberculosis (TB), most probably because of the severe groundwater contamination in these localities caused by the waste mountains here.
</p>
<p>
•	The residents claimed that the landfill leachate, generated from the waste dumps, seeps into the surface and contaminates groundwater. Devendra Kumar, director in chief of environment management service, North MCD, told Mail Today that as the civic agency has no other option they continue dumping garbage on the same landfill site for years
</p>
<p>
•	These landfills adversely affect sanitary workers health as waste from different corner of an urban area (Delhi) is transported to these three active land sites fill and is managed by them
</p>
<p>
•	Various type of toxic gases which are released from waste to energy plant negatively affect the health of people residing in the vicinity of this plan
</p>
<p>
•   Certain plastic bags may cause chemical filtration into the food. Those chemicals include styrene and bisphenol- A which can cause cancer, heart diseases and reproductive problems. Toxins could migrate from the plastic to the substances they hold.

<h1 style=align:center><b>Solution<b></h1>
<p>
    
    •	Avoid single-use plastics such as drinking straws.</p>
    <p>
•	If you go shopping, remember to take a cloth bag.</p>
<p>
•	Replace plastic Tupperware with glass or steel containers.
</p>
<p>
    •	Make those around you aware of the importance of reducing the consumption of plastic.
</p>
<p>
•	Our lifestyle sometimes prevents us from paying attention to details. Therefore, when it comes to recycling waste make sure plastic items end up in Non-Biodegradable bin.
</p>
<p>
•	Choose to refuse single use plastic whenever possible.
</p>
<p>
•	A bottle can be filled up as many times as you like ,but  if not washed regularly single use plastic bottles have a risk of bacterial growth which could be harmful to health .

    <h2><b> Introduction</b></h2>
    <p>
        Electronic waste or e-waste describes discarded electrical or electronic devices. Used electronics which are destined for refurbishment, reuse, resale, salvage recycling through material recovery, or disposal are also considered e-waste.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have serious concerns about unsafe handling of used electronics and e-waste, in developing countries, that results in harm to human health and the environment. For example, there are problems with open-air burning and acid baths being used to recover valuable materials from electronic components, which expose workers to harmful substances. There are also problems with toxic materials leaching into the environment. These practices can expose workers to high levels of contaminants such as lead, mercury, cadmium and arsenic, which can lead to irreversible health effects, including cancers, miscarriages, neurological damage and diminished IQs.
    </p>
    <h2><b>Types of E-Waste</b></h2>
    <p><b>
        Type 1</b>- Major appliances (refrigerators, washing machines, dryers etc.)</p>
<p><b>
Type 2</b> – Small appliances (vacuum cleaners, irons, blenders, fryers etc.)
</p>
<p><b>

Type 3</b> – Computer and telecommunication appliances (laptops, PCs, telephones, mobile phones etc.) 
<p><b>
Type 4</b> – Consumer electronics (video and audio equipment, musical instruments) 
<p><b>
Type 5</b> – Lighting devices (incandescent light bulbs, fluorescent tubes, gas-discharge lamps etc.) 
<p><b>
Type 6</b> – Electrical and electronic tools (drills, saws, gardening devices etc.)
<p><b>
Type 7</b> – Toys, leisure (electronic toys, models, sports equipment) 
<p><b>
Type 8</b> – Medical devices (all medical equipment with the exception of implants) 
<p><b>
Type 9</b> – Monitoring devices (detectors, thermostats, laboratory equipment etc.) 
<p><b>
Type. 10</b> – Vending machines
